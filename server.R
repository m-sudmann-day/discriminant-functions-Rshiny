# Generates a dataset containing three classifications of loan applications:
# Approved, Denied, and Undecided.  It separates these classifications with
# two separate discriminant functions and generates a graph showing the data
# points and boundary lines.  The first boundary line splits denied loans
# from all others because, presumably, it is better to deny a loan that
# should be approved than it is to approve a loan that should be denied.
# Second, the remaining points are split with another boundary that separates
# approved from undecided loans.  Note that this boundary line does not
# extend beyond the first boundary line so as to avoid creating ambiguous
# regions.  Displays the graph, and a confusion, in Shiny with input widgets
# that allow the user to modify parameters of the distributions of the classes.

# label - the label or classification to associate with the data to be created
